                    <a class="link" href="https://encodejustice.org">Encode Justice</a> is is an international
                    organization fighting for justice in the age of Artificial Intelligence (AI). In Canada, our goal is
                    simple: ensure that AI benefits people, not companies.
                    <a style="display: block;"></a>
                    We believe that young people should be included in the development and application of AI. As the
                    lines between the digital and “real world” blur, we must examine the effects technology has on our
                    everyday lives. Young people, who have grown up with social media and handheld computers in their
                    pockets, understand these impacts better than anyone. Our initiatives therefore target Canadian
                    youth and facilitate their inclusion in the AI ecosystem. If you are currently a student at a
                    Canadian post-secondary institution, <a class="link" href="https://forms.gle/XZZuXjjqUkmG7CnB7">join
